Attention soldier,

While i'm fighting to unify all of China, we need soldiers to write down the tales of the battlefields(editors). 
These tales are then for fututre generation of soldiers and civilians to remember what happened and who the people were on the battlefield.
Are you a new soldier eager to leave your mark in history? Did you find a story incomplete? Do you want to be a greatest great general under the heavens?
Although that spot is reserved for me, then you can edit those pages and start ranking up while gaining achievements.
If you don't know how the art of the battlefield then Ou Ki and Ren Pa left me some rules and guidelines to follow for future monsters.
Also your 5-man commander will be their to help(help page) you. You can always find one of my soldiers either by sending a messenger(chat) or post it to a mesege wall(forum).

See you on the battlefield soldier.
Shin of the Hi Shin Unit.
